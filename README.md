This project predicts a studentâ€™s exam score based on the number of study hours using Linear Regression, a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm.

It includes:

ðŸ§® A Jupyter Notebook (linear_regression_student_score.ipynb) demonstrating model training & evaluation.

ðŸ“Š A Streamlit web app (app.py) that allows users to input study hours and see predicted scores interactively.

âš¡ A FastAPI backend API (api.py) providing programmatic access for developers to get predictions via HTTP requests.

ðŸ“‚ A dataset (student_scores.csv) used to train the regression model.
